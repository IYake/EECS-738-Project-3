# EECS-738-Project-3
Creating a Neural Network

# Dataset
Typically to test classification models for computer vision, the MNIST dataset is used but I wanted to try something different so I found the [MNIST Fasion dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist). It consists of 28x28 black and white images of 10 classes of fashion objects.
0 = T-shirt/top,
1 = Trouser,
2 = Pullover,
3 = Dress,
4 = Coat,
5 = Sandal,
6 = Shirt,
7 = Sneaker,
8 = Bag,
9 = Ankle boot.
